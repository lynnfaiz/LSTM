# LSTM
This LSTM code is use to develop a prediciton model using time series data. 

1. Project Title
Prediciton model for time series data prediction using LSTM

2. Project Description: 
The code train and test the LSTM moel for predicting GIC.
It uses time series data related to the space weather.
This model can be used for other time series datasets.
This code runs on Matlab.

3. How to use it
Prepare your data with training datasets and testing datasets in one .mat file.
Then run the code.
The performance of your model will be released in copydata file
The hyperparameter can be tune to improve your model
To change from LSTM model to BiLSTM, activate the BiLSTM line by removing the comment symbol "%" and place it at the LSTM line.
